The license on the basis of "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE", but with some corrections:

1. The developer (who takes the source code) shall not use it for personal purposes (eg, to change the name of the launcher package and present to the public on its behalf), and work for the benefit of improving WLauncher-and in the future! Those. In simple words, the developer is obliged only to improve the launcher and not the source code to bind to its name.
2. The developer should mark your code comments. (For example:
// Vadik
private void test (String value)
{
})
3. If the developer agrees to the license and actually working for the benefit of improving the launcher, it automatically becomes a co-author.
4. If a person has downloaded the launcher in any store (such as Google Play, Yandex.Store, etc.), he is obliged to share all revenue with developers who have worked to improve the launcher.
